# Zelda Weapons and Materials Data

Welcome to the Zelda Weapons and Materials Data repository! This repository contains two CSV files (`materials.csv` and `weapons.csv`) that provide information about the materials and weapons found in the game "The Legend of Zelda Tears Of The Kingdom."

## Purpose and Usage

The data in these CSV files is directly related to the website [The Legend Of Zelda Tears Of The Kingdom Weapons Fuses](https://zelda-totk-weapons-fuses.netlify.app/). The purpose of the website is to provide a convenient way to test various combinations (referred to as "fuses") of weapons in the game.
